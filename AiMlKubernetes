Imagine you're leading a data science team at a healthcare analytics company. Your project aims to develop and deploy machine learning models that predict
patient health outcomes based on historical health data. The models are complex, requiring substantial computational resources for training, and need to 
be served efficiently to handle real-time prediction requests from hospitals and clinics.
You face several challenges in your project:
    Resource-Intensive Model Training: The models require training on vast and sensitive healthcare datasets, necessitating efficient job scheduling and 
resource management to minimize costs and training time.  High-Availability Model Serving: The models must be served with minimal latency and high 
availability to ensure that healthcare providers can access real-time predictive insights that affect patient care decisions.  Dynamic Model Updating: 
Healthcare regulations and guidelines frequently change, necessitating the models to be updated regularly without causing downtime or service disruption.
Question:
Given the challenges above, which combination of tools and strategies would best address the needs of your healthcare analytics project?
    a.    Utilize only Kubernetes native scheduling for training jobs and deploy models using a custom Flask application for serving.
    b.    Deploy models statically on dedicated servers and manually update models via SSH when regulations change.
    c.    Rely on external cloud-based AutoML services for model training and serving, bypassing the need for Kubernetes-based solutions.
    d.    Implement Volcano for batch job scheduling, use KServe for model serving, and manage model updates through Kubeflow Pipelines.

After developing a state-of-the-art duck detection system using unsupervised deep learning, your team has successfully segmented thousands of bird 
images into various clusters based on features like color, size, and environment. The model has identified patterns and grouped the images accordingly,
