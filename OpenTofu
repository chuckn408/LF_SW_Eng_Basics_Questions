Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice in which you manage and provision your infrastructure components—such as servers, networks, and storage—using code and software development techniques rather than manually configuring hardware and systems.


Consistency and Reliability
Automation and Efficiency
Version Control and Traceability
Scalability
Faster Recovery and Deployment
Cost Efficiency
Flexibility


There are generally two approaches to IaC: declarative (functional) and imperative (procedural)
The declarative approach describes the desired end state of the infrastructure.
The imperative approach defines the exact steps or commands to reach the desired state.


Popular IaC tools include OpenTofu, Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, Chef, and more.

OpenTofu is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. 


OpenTofu leverages application programming interfaces (APIs) to create and manage resources on cloud platforms and other services.

Additionally, OpenTofu's application process includes monitoring and handling any issues that arise during the execution

You define resources that may span multiple cloud providers and services. 
During the planning phase, OpenTofu generates a detailed execution plan outlining its specific infrastructure actions.
Once you approve the execution plan, OpenTofu implements the proposed changes by performing the necessary operations in the correct sequence.


OpenTofu uses providers, which are plugins enabling it to communicate with platforms like cloud services, SaaS applications, and APIs. To use OpenTofu, you must specify 
the providers your infrastructure needs. These providers are then downloaded and configured to work within your environment. Some may require additional details, such 
as the region of a cloud service or specific API endpoints, to function properly.


Resources in OpenTofu are the fundamental elements that represent the components of your infrastructure. They are the building blocks you define in your configuration 
files to manage and interact with various services and platforms. Each resource corresponds to a specific object or service provided by cloud providers, SaaS platforms, or other APIs.


OpenTofu uses a system called state to keep track of your infrastructure and how it connects to real-world resources. This state helps OpenTofu remember important details about 
your setup and ensures it works efficiently, especially with larger and more complex systems. It also enables OpenTofu to determine what changes are needed when updating your configurations.
